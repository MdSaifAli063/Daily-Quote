## 🌍 Browser Support

- Modern browsers (Chromium, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- Web Speech and Web Share APIs may have limited support on desktop; best on mobile browsers.
- If a feature isn’t supported, the app degrades gracefully.

---

## 🔐 Privacy

- All data (favorites) is stored locally on your device via LocalStorage.
- No tracking. No external backend calls by default.

---

## ♿ Accessibility

- Semantic landmarks: header, main, footer, aside.
- ARIA labels on interactive controls.
- Keyboard-navigable buttons.
- Color contrast mindful themes.
- Screen reader friendly labels on icons and controls.

---

## 🛠️ Development Tips

- Use a local server to ensure Clipboard/Web Speech/Web Share behave consistently.
- Keep quotes data and UI interactions decoupled in script.js.
- Consider adding debounce for rapid user actions (if needed).

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap Ideas

- Add more categories and quote sources.
- Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., N for next, F for favorite).
- Export favorites as JSON or text.
- PWA support for offline caching.
- Multilingual quotes and localization.
